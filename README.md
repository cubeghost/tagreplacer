# tag replacer

like the old one except i know what i'm doing this time lol?

`cp sample.env .env`


now using a customized version of [react-selectize](https://github.com/furqanZafar/react-selectize)


### todo
- [x] add advanced options (incl. "replace queued posts" option)
  - [ ] make these options persist in localstorage
  - [ ] make them less ugly
- [ ] add case insensitive option (or vice versa)
- [ ] add help page or at least link to a markdown file or s/t
- [ ] add react-router to facilitate the above
