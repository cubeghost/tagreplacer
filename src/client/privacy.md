`tag replacer` records basic usage logs for troubleshooting purposes only. these logs contain the blog name, find tags, and replace tags, as well as the number of posts found or replaced. they will never contain specific post IDs, post contents, your IP address, or other information about your tumblr account. 

usage logs are stored on the server (temporarily) and in [Sentry](https://sentry.io/security/), the platform we use for error reporting and performance monitoring. data is removed from Sentry after 14 days.
