If you are here to replace tags affected by the recent [iOS app update](https://wip.tumblr.com/post/671184848292118528/an-update-on-the-tumblr-ios-app), I personally would recommend leaving your tags as-is for now until we know more. As far as I know, the current workaround is intended to be temporary. 

If you find you can't access posts with tags that seem innocuous, or for other reasons shouldn't be "banned", please [report that as a bug to Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/support).
